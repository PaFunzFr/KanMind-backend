"""
Board views for listing/creating boards and retrieving/updating/deleting a single board.

Conventions:
- Uses DRF generic class-based views for standard CRUD patterns.
- Enforces authentication on all endpoints.
- Applies object-level permissions to restrict access based on ownership/membership.
- Chooses serializers by action to separate write, list, and detailed read concerns.
